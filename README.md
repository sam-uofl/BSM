Gene Selection from High-dimensional Gene Expression Data using 'BSM' Approach

  Gene selection from high dimensional expression data is a
  challenging task in gene expression genomics. Therefore, the
  package provides functions to select relevant genes based on
  the bootstrap-support vector machine-maximum relevance and
  minimum redundancy (BSM) approach from high dimensional gene
  expression data through the adjusted p-values. The genes selected
  based on these computed statistical significance values are
  more statistically informative and biologically relevant.
  Besides, it also provides functions to select genes based on
  gene ranking methods like support vector machine (SVM),
